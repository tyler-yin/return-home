# Return Home

Return Home is a browser-based interactive poem that explores the complex emotions associated with returning to an ancestral home. Embedded into a digital interface of eight dropdown menus that enclose a series of blurred images, the poem invites users to select words in order to reveal its verses. As the user's selections align more closely with my own—expressing a desire to better remember my familial history—the blurred images will progressively sharpen, longing to come into focus.
