# Return Home

This is an interactive web poem about returning home. Structured as an interface of eight dropdown menus, a user may uncover up to eight verses of text. As the user's selected words become more & more aligned with my own—expressions of a desire to remember the familial history that I wish I knew better—blurred images will become progressively clearer, longing to come into focus.
